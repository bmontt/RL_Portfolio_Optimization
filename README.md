## Introduction

Portfolio optimization aims to maximize returns while managing risk by selecting the best mix of assets. This project applies RL algorithms to dynamically adjust portfolio weights based on market conditions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmontt/RL_Portfolio_Optimization.git
cd RL_Portfolio_Optimization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the project, you can run the various scripts provided. For example, to scrape data, preprocess it, and then run the optimization algorithm:

1. **Scrape data**:
   ```bash
   python scrape.py
   ```

2. **Preprocess data**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Create database tables**:
   ```bash
   python create_tables.py
   ```

4. **Run the portfolio optimization**:
   ```bash
   python portfolio_optimization.py
   ```
